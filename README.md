Trajectory Forecast is a lightweight, modular extension built on top of Ultralytics YOLO that enables real-time multi-object 
tracking with future motion prediction. It combines detection, tracking, motion history modeling, and velocity-based forecasting 
into a unified pipeline that can be used both as a command-line tool and as a Python library. The system is designed for practical computer vision applications such as traffic analytics, surveillance systems, robotics pipelines, and edge AI deployments.

## Installation

```bash
pip install trajectory-forecast
```

## Usage

### CLI

Run tracking and forecasting on a video.

```bash
trajectory-forecast --model yolo26n.pt --source "https://tinyurl.com/bddswzba" --output result.mp4
```

If you want to adjust tracking and forecasting configuration, create a `config.yaml` in the directory and paste the mentioned content:

```yaml
conf: 0.5                   # object detection confidence threshold
tracker: "bytetrack.yaml"   # tracker selection, i.e., "botsort.yaml" or "bytetrack.yaml"
classes: [2, 3, 5]          # classes for object detection
history: 40                 # store tracking history for number of frames
min_points: 8               # minimum tracking history to start calculating forecasting
forecast_steps: 35          # total steps for forecasting, > 40 can cause gitter effect.
vel_window: 10              # previous frames used to estimate the object's velocity.
ema_alpha: 0.7              # used to smooth the velocity or trajectory prediction.
forecast_color: [255, 0, 0] # Forecast point color (B, G, R)
```

After that, you can run the code using the command mentioned below.

```bash
trajectory-forecast --model yolo26n.pt --source "https://tinyurl.com/bddswzba" --config "path/to/config.yaml"
```

### Python

```python
from tf import run_inference
from tf.config import ForecastConfig

config = ForecastConfig(conf=0.5, forecast_steps=50, ema_alpha=0.7, classes=[0, 2, 5, 6, 7])

run_inference(model_path="yolo26s.pt", source="https://tinyurl.com/2t2j2vs5", output_path="output.mp4", config=config)
```

## Forecasting methodology

The current forecasting implementation is based on:

* Exponential moving average smoothing of object centers
* Median velocity estimation over a sliding window
* Linear projection of future positions
* Stationary gating to prevent unstable predictions

This approach provides a stable and computationally efficient baseline suitable for real-time systems.
